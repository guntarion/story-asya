**A Shocking Experiment**

Nova adjusted her safety goggles and peered into the bubbling cauldron. Steam hissed and purple sparks crackled as she stirred the mysterious concoction with her wooden spoon. "Finally!" she exclaimed, wiping sweat from her forehead. "After three weeks of failed attempts, my shrinking potion is almost ready!"

What Nova didn't realize was that in her excitement, she had accidentally grabbed the wrong bottle from her messy potion shelf. Instead of the aging powder she thought she was adding, she had dumped an entire vial of past memory potion into the mix. The liquid turned an ominous shade of swirling green and gold.

"This is it!" Nova declared, holding up the steaming flask. "Time to test it!"

Just then, her friend Adam burst through the laboratory door, his face flushed from running. "Nova, you have to help me! Blingy is driving me crazy. He keeps begging me to make him smaller so he can fit through the doggy door instead of using the regular door like a normal person!"

"Perfect timing!" Nova grinned mischievously. "I have just the thing!"

Blingy shuffled into the lab behind Adam, his shoulders slumped dramatically. "Please, please, PLEASE! I just want to be tiny! It would be so much more fun to crawl through small spaces and hide in dollhouses!"

Nova held up her potion triumphantly. "Blingy, your dreams are about to come true!"

But as Blingy reached for the flask, he wrinkled his nose. "Ugh, it smells like old socks mixed with pickle juice. Are you sure this is safe? I'm not really one to take risks, you know."

"Trust me," Nova said confidently, though she was secretly wondering why her shrinking potion smelled so strange. "Science waits for no one!"

Adam threw his hands up in exasperation. "Stop asking so many questions, Blingy! You've been begging for this for weeks!"

Before anyone could stop him, Blingy grabbed the potion and chugged it down in one gulp. For a moment, nothing happened. Then suddenly, his eyes went wide and glassy, and a huge grin spread across his face.

"I want to ride my bike and play with my friends!" Blingy announced cheerfully, bouncing on his toes like a five-year-old.

Nova and Adam exchanged confused glances. This was definitely not the reaction they expected from a shrinking potion.

"Uhh... Blingy?" Nova said slowly. "Didn't you just say you were too old for bike riding last week? You said it was 'childish and beneath your dignity.'"

Blingy gasped dramatically. "Too old? It's never too old to ride my bike! I love my bike! It has streamers on the handlebars and everything!"

Nova's confusion deepened. As far as she knew, Blingy didn't even own a bike. He usually took the bus everywhere and complained about any form of exercise.

"Uhh... about that," Nova said carefully, "your so-called 'bike' is broken, remember? You said you threw it away years ago."

Blingy's face crumpled like he was about to cry. "Why is it broken? Did I break it? Did someone else break it? Can we fix it? I promise I'll be more careful this time!"

Suddenly, Nova's face went pale as she realized her terrible mistake. She rushed to her potion shelf and grabbed the empty bottle she had used. The label clearly read "PAST MEMORY POTION - CAUTION: May cause subject to revert to childhood behaviors and memories!"

"Oh no, oh no, OH NO!" Nova panicked. "I used the wrong ingredient! This isn't a shrinking potion at all!"

Meanwhile, Blingy had found Adam's old jump rope and was skipping around the laboratory, singing nursery rhymes at the top of his lungs. "Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posies!"

Adam stared in horror. "Nova, what did you DO to him?"

"I accidentally gave him a past memory potion!" Nova frantically flipped through her spell book. "It's making him remember and act like his childhood self!"

Just then, Blingy stopped jumping and looked around the room with wide, innocent eyes. "Where are my Pokemon cards? And my action figures? Ooh! Can we play hide and seek?"

"We have to fix this before my parents get home!" Nova declared, mixing ingredients at lightning speed.

But creating an antidote was trickier than expected. Her first attempt turned Blingy's hair bright pink. The second made him speak only in rhymes for ten minutes. The third gave him an uncontrollable urge to do cartwheels.

"This is a disaster!" Adam groaned as Blingy cartwheeled past him for the fifteenth time.

Finally, Nova remembered something from her grandmother's old potion journal. She carefully mixed moonwater, crushed lavender, and a drop of her own tears of frustration. The mixture glowed softly blue.

"Blingy, drink this!" she called out.

Blingy, who was now trying to build a fort out of laboratory stools, looked up suspiciously. "Will it taste yucky?"

"I promise it tastes like strawberry milk," Nova lied desperately.

Blingy drank the antidote, made a face (it definitely didn't taste like strawberry milk), and then blinked several times. Slowly, his adult memories returned.

"Wait... what just happened?" he asked, looking around confused. "Why am I covered in glitter? And why does my mouth taste like pickle juice?"

Nova and Adam burst into relieved laughter.

"Well," Blingy said, stretching and trying to regain his dignity, "I guess I accidentally revealed my secret again."

"What secret?" Nova and Adam asked in unison.

Blingy's cheeks turned red. "That... I actually do still have my old bike in my garage. And sometimes, when no one's looking, I still ride it around the block. It makes me feel happy."

Nova grinned. "You know what, Blingy? There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, want to go for a bike ride right now? All three of us?"

And so, instead of a shrinking potion, Nova's experiment led to something much better - a fun afternoon with friends and the discovery that sometimes the best adventures happen when things don't go according to plan.

From that day forward, Nova always double-checked her potion labels. Well, most of the time anyway.
