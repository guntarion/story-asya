### Episode 1: The Challenge Nobody Asked For

It was a peaceful Saturday morning at Edo Motors. Emphasis on *was*.

Edo had just finished installing a brand new kitchen in the back of the garage — a tiny corner with a stove, a fridge, and a dream. The idea was simple: if he could cook meals for the Cardbots instead of buying overpriced gasoline and industrial-grade electricity, maybe — just MAYBE — he could stop hemorrhaging money like a broken fire hydrant.

"Welcome to Edo's Kitchen!" he announced proudly, gesturing at the modest setup. "From now on, we're making Machinasium-infused energy stew instead of guzzling premium fuel!"

Blue Cop nodded approvingly. "Fiscal responsibility. I respect that."

Mega Trucker was already swaying to imaginary music. "Does the stew come with soul? Because my body needs SOUL FOOD, baby."

Flash Vector leaned against the wall in his typical cool-guy pose, arms crossed. "As long as it's fast. I don't do slow meals."

And then there was Spark Bit.

The yellow boxer Cardbot was doing one-armed push-ups in the corner, his Destroy Gloves clanking against the concrete with each rep. His green eyes flicked toward the kitchen setup with the intensity of a hawk spotting a mouse.

"A kitchen?" Spark Bit said, standing up and cracking his knuckles with a sound like thunderclaps. "You're telling me the great challenge of the day is... COOKING?"

"It's not a challenge," Edo said carefully, sensing danger. "It's just lunch."

"EVERYTHING is a challenge!" Spark Bit slammed his fist into his palm, sending a small shockwave that rattled the pots. "And I, Spark Bit, am the CHAMPION of ALL challenges! I'll make the greatest meal this planet has ever tasted!"

Flash Vector sighed. "Spark Bit, you once tried to eat a tire because you thought it was a donut."

"It was SHAPED like a donut! That's false advertising!"

"It was on a car."

"AN UGLY CAR!"

Before anyone could stop him, Spark Bit had already shoved Edo aside, tied an apron around his waist (backwards, over his head like a cape), and was standing in the kitchen with the confidence of a five-star chef and the skill of someone who had never seen food before.

"Step aside, everyone! The Spark Bit Cooking Experience begins NOW!"

### Episode 2: 600 Punches Per Second (In The Kitchen)

Spark Bit's first challenge: kneading dough.

"Flour, water, yeast," he read from a recipe card, squinting at it like it was written in an alien language. Which, to be fair, it technically was — Edo had written it in Korean. "Easy. I'll have this done in three seconds."

He dumped an entire bag of flour into a bowl. Then two bags. Then, for good measure, a third.

"Spark Bit, the recipe says TWO cups—" Theo started.

"CUPS ARE FOR THE WEAK!" Spark Bit activated his Destroy Gloves, the jagged gauntlets crackling with electric energy. "Behold! The ultimate kneading technique!"

**SPARKING FORCE KNUCKLE!**

Spark Bit's fists became a blur, hammering the dough at 600 punches per second. The bowl shattered instantly. The flour erupted into a mushroom cloud that engulfed the entire garage. Dough splattered across the ceiling, the walls, Blue Cop's freshly polished armor, and a pigeon that had made the catastrophic mistake of flying past the window.

"MY PAINT JOB!" Blue Cop roared, wiping flour from his visor.

"THAT'S the spirit!" Spark Bit shouted from inside the flour cloud, completely blind. "Who wants ROUND TWO?"

"Nobody wants round ONE!" Edo screamed, watching his kitchen disappear under a layer of sticky dough. "You just destroyed twelve dollars' worth of flour! Do you know how much that is on my budget?! THAT'S MY ELECTRICITY BILL!"

Flash Vector, who had been wise enough to activate stealth mode the moment Spark Bit touched an apron, reappeared on the roof. "I'm not cleaning that up."

But Spark Bit was undeterred. If anything, the destruction only fueled his determination.

"That was just a warm-up! The dough wasn't READY for my power! I need to go HARDER!"

"Please don't go harder," everyone said simultaneously.

### Episode 3: The Stew That Fought Back

Attempt number two: Machinasium-infused energy stew.

This time, Spark Bit had a plan. And by "plan," he meant "hit things slightly less hard."

He gathered the ingredients with surprising care — vegetables from the garden Dexter had been growing (Dexter nearly had a meltdown), some Machinasium shavings provided by Mega Ambler, and a special broth Edo had prepared.

"See?" Spark Bit said smugly, arranging everything on the counter. "I can be precise. I can be DELICATE."

He picked up a carrot.

He stared at the carrot.

The carrot did not stare back, because it was a carrot.

"I need to chop this," Spark Bit said. He looked at his Destroy Gloves. He looked at the carrot. He looked at the Destroy Gloves again.

"Don't you dare—" Anna started.

**SPARKING HAMMER!**

Spark Bit brought both gauntlets down on the cutting board with the force of a small meteorite. The carrot was atomized. So was the cutting board. And the counter. And a solid chunk of the floor.

"PERFECTLY DICED!" Spark Bit declared, standing in a crater.

"That carrot no longer exists on a MOLECULAR LEVEL!" Theo shouted, his glasses askew.

"That means it's extra fine-chopped!"

Despite the carnage, they eventually got ingredients into a pot. Spark Bit insisted on stirring with his Destroy Gloves, which turned the gentle simmer into a violent whirlpool that splashed scalding stew everywhere. Mega Trucker tried to help by shielding people with his Mega Protector, which just redirected the stew-nami toward Crest, who had been peacefully reading in the corner.

"My BOOK!" Crest shrieked, holding up a novel now marinated in vegetable broth. "This was a FIRST EDITION!"

The stew, apparently fed up with being abused, began to bubble ominously. The Machinasium shavings, agitated by Spark Bit's electric punches, started to GLOW.

"Is it supposed to do that?" Jun asked nervously.

"NOTHING is 'supposed' to do ANYTHING in this kitchen anymore!" Edo wailed.

The pot erupted like a tiny volcano, launching a geyser of glowing green stew straight through the roof. It rained electric soup across a three-block radius.

From somewhere in the neighborhood, a confused voice yelled: "WHY DOES IT TASTE LIKE BATTERIES AND ANGER?!"

### Episode 4: The Unexpected Chef

Spark Bit stood in the ruins of Edo's Kitchen, covered head-to-toe in glowing stew, surrounded by the disappointed faces of every Cardbot and human in Mowtown.

His apron-cape was singed. His Destroy Gloves were dripping with broth. The kitchen looked like a war zone that had lost a war against a bigger war zone.

For the first time, Spark Bit's cocky grin faltered.

"I..." he started. "I just wanted to show everyone I could do it."

Flash Vector dropped down from the roof, landing silently beside his brother. "Spark Bit, you're the best fighter I know. You once punched a meteor out of the sky. Why do you need to be the best at cooking too?"

"Because I'm supposed to be the BEST!" Spark Bit's fists clenched. "At EVERYTHING! If I can't win at something, then what am I?"

The garage went quiet.

Then, from outside, came a rumbling sound. A very LARGE rumbling sound. The kind of rumbling that meant either an earthquake or—

"FULL-BELLIED BUFFALO CRUSH SMELLS SOMETHING DELICIOUS!"

Buffalo Crush, the magenta monster truck pirate with a Viking helmet and the intelligence of a friendly boulder, crashed through the garage door (the THIRD time this month, Edo noted with dead eyes).

"FOOD! BUFFALO CRUSH WANTS FOOD!" The massive bot looked around at the destruction. Then at the glowing stew dripping from the ceiling. He stuck out a finger, caught a drop, and tasted it.

Everyone braced for the worst.

"Mmmmm! Good base flavor! But needs salt. And less electricity." Buffalo Crush waddled into the destroyed kitchen with the casual confidence of someone who'd spent years obsessing over energy consumption. "You — yellow punchy bot. You put in the Machinasium BEFORE the broth cooled, yes? Classic mistake. Machinasium activates at sixty degrees. Below that, it just adds flavor. Above that..." He gestured at the stew-stained ceiling. "Boom."

Everyone stared.

"What?" Buffalo Crush blinked his small eyes. "Buffalo Crush LIKES food! Food is energy! Energy is LIFE! Buffalo Crush watches cooking shows! ALL of them! Even the boring ones about sourdough!"

### Episode 5: The Rematch (With an Apron)

What happened next would go down in Mowtown history as the most unlikely cooking partnership ever formed.

Buffalo Crush, with surprising gentleness, guided Spark Bit through the basics. And by "guided," he meant physically holding Spark Bit's arms to prevent him from destroying things.

"GENTLE stirring!" Buffalo Crush instructed. "Pretend the soup is a baby bird!"

"I've never held a baby bird!" Spark Bit protested.

"Then pretend it's something you DON'T want to punch!"

"...I want to punch most things!"

"Then pretend it's your brother!"

Spark Bit paused. Looked at Flash Vector. Thought about it.

"...Okay, I can work with that."

Slowly — painfully, hilariously slowly — Spark Bit learned. He learned that his 600-punches-per-second technique was perfect for whipping eggs (at about one percent power). He learned that his electric energy could precisely heat a pan (without melting it, if he concentrated REALLY hard). And he learned that cooking, like fighting, required timing, patience, and knowing when NOT to use maximum force.

Flash Vector, unable to resist, joined in too. His stealth skills turned out to be perfect for sneaking ingredients into the pot at precisely the right moment — the culinary equivalent of a ninja ambush. "Herbs: deployed," he whispered dramatically, sprinkling rosemary like a covert operation.

By sunset, the rebuilt kitchen (Dexter and Mega Ambler had done emergency repairs) was filled with the most incredible smell any of them had ever experienced.

"Presenting," Buffalo Crush announced with theatrical flair, "the KNOCKOUT STEW! Created by Chef Spark Bit, with assistance from Sous Chef Flash Vector, and executive consultation by the great Buffalo Crush!"

Spark Bit carefully — CAREFULLY — ladled stew into bowls. His hands were steady. His Destroy Gloves were off for the first time anyone could remember. He looked... different. Calmer. Almost humble.

Everyone took a bite.

Silence.

Then Mega Trucker's eyes went wide. "This... this has SOUL!"

"It's actually incredible," Anna said, genuinely shocked.

"The Machinasium integration is flawless," Theo confirmed, adjusting his glasses. "Smooth, energizing, zero explosive properties."

Even Blue Cop nodded. "Acceptable. Very acceptable."

Spark Bit's face broke into a grin — not his usual cocky smirk, but something warmer. Realer.

"I didn't do it alone," he said, bumping his fist against Buffalo Crush's enormous arm. "Turns out, even a champion needs a teacher."

Buffalo Crush beamed so hard his Viking helmet tilted. "FULL-BELLIED BUFFALO CRUSH IS ALSO FULL-HEARTED!"

### Episode 6: The Recipe for Real Strength

Later that night, Spark Bit sat on the roof of Edo Motors, looking up at the stars. Flash Vector materialized beside him, silent as always.

"You know," Spark Bit said quietly, "on Machina, I always thought being the strongest meant being the best at everything. That's why I challenged you to that fight when we first met. That's why I always need to win."

Flash Vector sat down beside him. "And now?"

"Now I think... being strong means knowing when you need help. And being brave enough to accept it. Even from a pirate who talks in third person."

Flash Vector chuckled — a rare, genuine laugh. "You made a pretty good stew, little brother."

"DON'T call me 'little brother.' I punched you into a sunset once."

"You punched NEAR me during a sunset. There's a difference."

"Nah, I'm pretty sure I got you."

"You absolutely did not."

They bickered under the stars, but neither of them stopped smiling. Below, in the garage, Edo calculated that Spark Bit's stew cost approximately one-tenth of what their usual fuel bill ran. He nearly cried with joy.

And in the kitchen, pinned to the fridge with a magnet, was a handwritten recipe card in Spark Bit's surprisingly neat handwriting:

> **Knockout Stew**
> *Step 1: Do NOT use Sparking Force Knuckle on the ingredients.*
> *Step 2: Seriously, DON'T.*
> *Step 3: Ask for help. It's not weakness. It's wisdom.*
> *Step 4: Add salt.*

## The Lesson

**Being talented at one thing doesn't mean you have to be the best at everything — and admitting you need help isn't weakness, it's the ultimate strength.** Spark Bit learned that his incredible fighting power couldn't solve every problem, and that the bravest thing a champion can do is become a student again. Sometimes your greatest teachers come from the most unexpected places — even a food-obsessed pirate who watches cooking shows!

**Remember:** Nobody is great at everything, and that's perfectly okay. The people around you have skills and knowledge that can fill in your gaps, just like you have gifts that can help them. Whether it's cooking, schoolwork, sports, or life — the real champions are the ones humble enough to say "teach me" and brave enough to try something new, even if they fail spectacularly the first time. And hey, if you accidentally launch electric soup through a roof... at least it makes a good story!
