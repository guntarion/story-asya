# The Great Speed Showdown

## When Competition Becomes Chaos

The morning sun glinted off the empty highway stretching out of Mowtown like a ribbon of pure possibility. Red Blitz stood at one end in his sleek Toyota 86 muscle car form, his red paint job practically vibrating with excitement.

"I'm telling you, Cielo," Red Blitz's voice crackled through his communicator, "there's no way that Formula One wannabe is faster than me. I've been racing since before he even got his first spark!"

Cielo, hovering in his Yak-130 fighter jet mode, chuckled. "Red, you do realize Flash Vector is literally designed for speed, right? His vehicle mode is a Formula One car. That's... kind of his whole thing."

"DESIGNED for speed?" Red Blitz's engine revved indignantly. "I am speed! I was the fastest thing on the Speranza! I can outrun a solar flare! I once—"

"Once got stuck in reverse for three hours because you were showing off?" came a smooth, cool voice.

Flash Vector rolled up in his navy-blue F1 car form, his closed cockpit gleaming. Even his idle was somehow more aerodynamic than Red Blitz's.

Red Blitz's tires screeched as he spun to face his rival. "That was ONE TIME! And it was a mechanical glitch!"

"Sure it was," Flash Vector said, his light-blue visor flashing with amusement. "Look, Red Blitz, everyone knows you're fast. For a muscle car. But when you need REAL speed—supersonic, stealth-mode, Formula One speed—you call someone like me."

Red Blitz transformed into robot mode so fast he left tire marks in the shape of an angry face. His Boost Gambiera leg armor gleamed as he struck a Muay Thai fighting stance.

"Okay, that's IT! You and me, right now! Race to the old water tower and back! Loser has to admit the winner is the fastest Cardbot on Earth!"

Flash Vector transformed smoothly, his front wing chest piece adjusting automatically. "You're on. But when I win, you're also making me that special Machinasium smoothie Gigantrex keeps talking about."

"DEAL!"

Jun, watching from Edo Motors with a very bad feeling, grabbed his communicator. "Guys, maybe this isn't—"

Too late. Both speedsters had already transformed and LAUNCHED down the highway like missiles, leaving behind a sonic boom that rattled every window in Mowtown.

---

For exactly forty-three seconds, it was an honest race.

Red Blitz took the lead initially, his muscle car torque giving him explosive acceleration. Flash Vector stayed close, his F1 aerodynamics cutting through the air like a knife through butter.

They were neck-and-neck, wheel-to-wheel, two blurs of red and blue tearing down the highway at speeds that would make fighter pilots nervous.

And then Red Blitz made a mistake. He glanced at his side mirror and saw Flash Vector gaining on him.

"Oh no you don't!" Red Blitz swerved slightly, just enough to force Flash Vector to brake.

Flash Vector's light-blue eyes narrowed. "Really? We're doing THIS?"

He activated his back-wheel thrusters and SHOT forward, clipping Red Blitz's rear bumper in the process.

"HEY!" Red Blitz shouted. "That's sabotage!"

"You started it!"

"Oh, it is SO on!"

What had started as a race immediately devolved into vehicular chaos. Red Blitz transformed mid-drive, running on his Boost Gambiera legs at top speed while firing energy blasts behind him. Flash Vector weaved through the attacks, transformed, and used his wing-thrusters to fly just above the road surface.

"Guys!" Jun's voice came through their comms. "You're destroying the HIGHWAY!"

Indeed, the road behind them looked like it had been hit by a small meteor shower. Blast craters, tire marks, and one confused raccoon holding a stop sign.

Back in Mowtown, Tachy was practicing her speed doodles on the art tunnel wall when she heard the approaching chaos.

"What is that sound?" she asked, her cheetah-patterned armor tilting as she listened. Then she saw them—two speeding blurs destroying everything in their path.

Her optics lit up. "A RACE?! COUNT ME IN!"

Before Blue Cop could stop her (he didn't even try), Tachy transformed into her sports car mode and ROCKETED toward the chaos, her cheetah-face hood ornament grinning wildly.

She caught up with Flash Vector first. "Room for one more?"

Flash Vector glanced at her, saw another speedster, and made an instant decision. "You're on Team Flash! Help me take down that show-off muscle car!"

"TEAM FLASH! I love it!"

Cielo, still watching from above, saw his Speranza crewmate getting double-teamed. His playful nature kicked into overdrive.

"Oh NO you don't!" He activated his Nitro Express machine guns and dove toward the race, firing warning shots that kicked up asphalt in front of Tachy. "Nobody gangs up on Red Blitz except me! That's like, Speranza Crew Law!"

"THERE IS NO SUCH LAW!" Red Blitz shouted, but he was grinning. Having backup felt good.

Now it was two-on-two, and the highway was about to become a war zone.

---

Tachy and Flash Vector worked together like they'd been partners for years. Tachy would speed ahead, leaving doodles on road signs that distracted Red Blitz, while Flash Vector used his stealth mode to disappear and reappear in Red Blitz's blind spots.

But Red Blitz was a Muay Thai master, and his combat instincts were razor-sharp. Every time Flash Vector appeared, Red Blitz would spin-kick with his Boost Gambiera, sending shockwaves that forced both speedsters to dodge.

Meanwhile, Cielo was having the time of his life, doing barrel rolls and loop-de-loops while providing air support. "Red! On your six!"

"Got it!" Red Blitz transformed mid-run, did a backflip off a destroyed mailbox, and landed a flying knee strike that would have made a martial arts master weep with joy. Flash Vector barely dodged.

"Is that all you got?" Flash Vector taunted, converting his back wheels into thrusters and flying in a corkscrew pattern.

"I'VE GOT PLENTY!" Red Blitz launched into a spinning kick combo that accidentally destroyed a billboard, a bus stop, and a very surprised food truck.

"MY TACOS!" someone screamed in the distance.

Jun, watching the destruction unfold via drone camera, buried his face in his hands. "Anna is going to KILL me. The Mayor is going to KILL me. Blue Cop is definitely going to say 'I told you so.'"

Blue Cop, standing next to him, opened his mouth.

"DON'T," Jun said.

Blue Cop closed his mouth but looked *extremely* smug.

The battle-race reached the old water tower, which had been the original turnaround point. However, the four Cardbots were now so focused on fighting each other that they completely forgot about it.

"SONIC HURRICANE!" Tachy yelled, running in circles so fast she created a literal tornado of cheetah-print energy.

"SCARLET HURRICANE!" Red Blitz countered with his own spinning kick tornado, now red and flaming.

The two tornado attacks collided, creating a DOUBLE HURRICANE that sucked up trash cans, lawn furniture, and one very unfortunate weather vane that had seen better days.

Flash Vector saw his opening. He activated maximum thrust and shot through the center of the double hurricane, aiming straight for Red Blitz.

But Cielo, using his intuitive nature, predicted the move.

"RED! DOWN!"

Red Blitz dropped flat, and Flash Vector sailed over him, crashing directly into the water tower.

CRREEEEAAAAK.

Everyone froze.

The water tower wobbled.

"Uh oh," Flash Vector said.

CRASH!

The entire water tower collapsed, releasing thousands of gallons of water that turned the battlefield into an instant tsunami. All four Cardbots were swept away, tumbling and shouting and generally looking very un-heroic as they were washed back toward Mowtown in a flood of mechanical embarrassment.

---

When the water finally drained, the four Cardbots found themselves deposited in a muddy, destroyed parking lot. They were battered, covered in dirt, and surrounded by the wreckage they'd caused: bent street signs, broken benches, exploded fire hydrants, and one very angry pigeon.

And standing before them, arms crossed, was Gigantrex.

The massive red semi-truck Cardbot looked down at them with the disappointed stare of a father who had just caught his kids raiding the cookie jar with a forklift.

"Would someone," Gigantrex said slowly, "like to explain to me why I just received fourteen emergency calls about 'giant robot destruction racing' and a flooded commercial district?"

The four speedsters looked at each other. Then at the ground. Then back at Gigantrex.

"...Flash Vector started it?" Red Blitz tried.

"Red Blitz started it!" Flash Vector countered.

"I just wanted to draw on things!" Tachy added.

"I was helping!" Cielo finished.

Gigantrex's Rex Arm gauntlet clenched. "Sit. Down."

They sat. Even though they were robots who didn't technically need to sit, they sat. Very quickly.

---

Gigantrex began pacing, his massive frame making the ground shake with each step. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of four thousand years and the patience of a captain who had shepherded a colony ship through the void.

"I understand the desire to compete," he began. "On Machina, we had races. Tournaments. Tests of speed and strength. Competition is natural. It pushes us to improve, to innovate, to become better versions of ourselves."

He turned to face them, his T-Rex gauntlet gesturing to the destruction around them.

"But THIS? This is not competition. This is ego. This is pride gone toxic. You weren't racing to see who was faster. You were fighting to prove who was *superior*. And in doing so, you forgot the most important rule of competition."

"What rule?" Red Blitz asked quietly.

"That it's not about BEATING your opponent," Gigantrex said. "It's about BECOMING YOUR BEST SELF. When you compete healthily, your rival makes you *better*. They push you to new heights. They reveal your weaknesses so you can strengthen them. A true rival is not an enemy—they're a partner in your growth."

Flash Vector looked at Red Blitz. Red Blitz looked at Flash Vector.

"But he said I was slow," Red Blitz mumbled.

"And you said I was a 'Formula One wannabe,'" Flash Vector muttered.

"BOTH OF YOU ARE THE FASTEST CARDBOTS I'VE EVER SEEN!" Gigantrex's voice boomed, making them jump. "Red Blitz, your acceleration and combat instincts are LEGENDARY. Flash Vector, your top speed and precision are UNMATCHED. You're not rivals—you're TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN!"

He let that sink in. Then, more gently, he continued.

"Competition should build, not destroy. It should create excellence, not chaos. When athletes race, they don't blow up the track—they use it to push each other to break records. When engineers compete, they don't sabotage each other's designs—they inspire better innovations."

Gigantrex knelt down, bringing his massive frame closer to their level.

"If you two actually worked *together* instead of against each other, you could design the fastest racing protocols in the galaxy. Red Blitz, your explosive starts combined with Flash Vector's sustained speed? That's a combination that could revolutionize how Cardbots move. But you'll never discover that if you're too busy trying to prove who's superior."

Tachy raised her hand. "What about us? Cielo and me?"

Gigantrex smiled, something rare and warm. "Tachy, you have speed and creativity. Cielo, you have aerial support and intuition. Instead of picking sides in someone else's rivalry, imagine if the four of you collaborated. You could map every speed route in Mowtown. Create emergency response protocols. Maybe even teach the human kids about racing safety."

"Racing... safety?" Red Blitz said, trying out the words like they were foreign objects.

"Productive competition," Gigantrex clarified. "Not destructive chaos."

---

There was a long silence. Then Red Blitz stood up and walked over to Flash Vector. He extended his hand.

"You're... really fast," Red Blitz admitted. "Faster than me in a straightaway."

Flash Vector looked at the hand, then up at Red Blitz's face. Slowly, he took it.

"You're faster off the line," Flash Vector admitted. "And your combat reflexes are insane. I can't do half the moves you pulled today."

They shook hands. It was awkward. It was sincere. And it was a start.

Tachy bounced up. "So... does this mean we're forming a SPEED TEAM?!"

Cielo landed next to them, transforming to robot mode. "Ooh, can we have matching paint jobs?"

"Absolutely not," all three said at once.

But they were smiling.

---

One week later, the "Mowtown Speed Initiative" was officially launched.

Red Blitz and Flash Vector designed a training course that helped emergency response vehicles (both Cardbot and human) navigate the city faster and safer. Tachy painted racing lines and speed limit reminders on the art tunnel walls—legal, creative, and helpful. Cielo mapped aerial routes for disaster response.

And every Saturday morning, they held friendly races. *Friendly* races. With rules. And timers. And Jun as the referee.

Did Red Blitz and Flash Vector still argue about who was faster? Absolutely.

But now, instead of destroying things, they were building something. A community. A system. A legacy.

And whenever they started getting too heated, Gigantrex would appear on the horizon, his Rex Arm gauntlet visible even from a distance, and they'd suddenly remember that competition was a tool, not a weapon.

Jun, watching one of their official races from the sidelines, turned to Gigantrex.

"You're good at this whole 'wise mentor' thing."

Gigantrex chuckled, a sound like rolling thunder. "I had four thousand years in stasis to think about leadership. You pick up a few lessons."

On the track, Red Blitz and Flash Vector crossed the finish line at exactly the same time. They immediately started arguing about whose front bumper crossed first.

"Same time next week?" Flash Vector challenged.

"You're on," Red Blitz grinned. "But this time, I'm breaking your record."

"Not if I break yours first."

But this time, they were both smiling. And when they fist-bumped at the starting line for the next round, the *CLANG* of metal on metal sounded less like a fight...

...and more like the start of something great.

## The Lesson

**Healthy competition brings out the best in everyone—but only when the goal is growth, not domination.** Red Blitz and Flash Vector learned that a rival isn't someone to destroy, but someone who challenges you to be better. Competing is natural and fun, but when it becomes about *beating* someone rather than *becoming* better yourself, that's when it turns destructive.

**Remember:** The people you compete with can become your greatest teammates if you let them. Whether it's sports, grades, art, or games—aim to lift each other up, not tear each other down. And when you win, celebrate. When they win, congratulate them. Because a true champion knows that the best victories come when everyone gets stronger together. And hey, if things get out of hand? It's okay to call in a wise mentor who's been around for four thousand years!
