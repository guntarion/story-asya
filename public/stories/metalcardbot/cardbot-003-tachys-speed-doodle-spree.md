# Tachy's Speed Doodle Spree

## The Fastest Artist in Mowtown

Blue Cop prided himself on knowing every street, alley, and shortcut in Mowtown. As a former police officer of Planet Machina and a proud member of the Star Guardians, maintaining order was not just his duty—it was his entire identity.

So when he rolled out of Edo Motors on a quiet Tuesday morning and immediately spotted a bright pink cheetah doodle spray-painted across the side of a grocery store, his optics narrowed dangerously.

"What... is THAT?"

The doodle was unmistakable—a cartoonish cheetah face with its tongue sticking out, surrounded by stars and lightning bolts. It was messy, colorful, and completely unauthorized.

"VANDALISM!" Blue Cop declared, his Justice Gauntlet clenching. "This is a CRIME against public property!"

He activated his communicator. "Jun! We have a situation. Someone has defaced the east side of Mowtown with unauthorized markings!"

Jun's voice came through, groggy. "Blue Cop... it's 6 AM..."

"Crime does not SLEEP, Jun! Neither should justice!"

By the time Blue Cop finished his patrol, he had documented seventeen separate incidents of graffiti. Cheetah faces on mailboxes. Lightning bolts on park benches. A massive doodle of a running figure on the side of the community center. And every single one was done in the same style—fast, messy strokes that suggested the artist worked at incredible speed.

"Seventeen violations," Blue Cop reported grimly at Edo Motors, where Jun, Theo, Anna, and Mega Trucker had gathered. "All committed within a single night. The perpetrator is fast, reckless, and has absolutely no respect for public property."

"They're actually kind of cute," Anna said, looking at Blue Cop's photos. "Look at the little whiskers on this one!"

"CUTE is not a legal defense!" Blue Cop sputtered.

Mega Trucker leaned over to look, his massive frame making the garage floor groan. "Huh. That running figure kinda looks like a track athlete. With a tail."

Theo adjusted his glasses. "The paint patterns suggest extremely rapid application—each piece was probably completed in under three seconds. That level of speed narrows down our suspects considerably."

Everyone slowly turned to look at each other.

"Tachy," they all said at once.

---

Tachy was the newest arrival at Edo Motors—a Wild Cardbot with a cheetah motif who transformed into a sleek sports car. She was also the first female Cardbot any of them had met, and she had arrived on Earth only two weeks ago after being freed from the Beast Virus.

The problem was, nobody had really spent much time with her since then.

Blue Cop found her behind the garage, sitting on an overturned oil drum, idly scratching patterns into the dirt with the tip of her Sonic Runner leg armor. Little swirls and zigzags that she created and erased at lightning speed.

"TACHY!" Blue Cop boomed in his best officer voice.

Tachy jumped so fast she became a blur, reappearing on top of the garage roof in a fraction of a second. "What?! Who?! I wasn't doing anything!"

"You are the primary suspect in seventeen counts of vandalism across Mowtown!" Blue Cop pointed an accusatory finger. "Those cheetah doodles have YOUR signature all over them!"

Tachy's optics darted left. Then right. Then she grinned. "Prove it."

"The evidence is OVERWHELMING! Speed analysis, artistic motif, the fact that you literally just ran up a wall—"

"That's circumstantial!" Tachy shot back, leaping down and landing in a runner's stance. "And besides, even if it WAS me—which I'm not saying it was—since when is making things pretty a crime?"

"Since the Mowtown Municipal Code, Section 14, Subsection B: 'No person—or alien mechanical lifeform—shall deface public or private property with unauthorized markings!'"

Tachy groaned. "You memorized the ENTIRE municipal code?!"

"Of course I did. I am a law enforcement officer."

"You're a *robot cop from outer space* who turns into a *Lamborghini*. Maybe loosen up a little?"

Blue Cop's optics flickered with barely contained frustration. "Tachy. You will cease and desist ALL graffiti activities immediately. This is an ORDER."

Tachy crossed her arms, her cheetah-patterned armor gleaming defiantly. "Make me."

And then she was gone—a yellow blur shooting down the street, leaving behind nothing but a gust of wind and, somehow, a tiny doodle of a cheetah face on Blue Cop's shoulder armor.

"TACHYYYYY!"

What followed was the most chaotic day Mowtown had ever seen.

Blue Cop chased Tachy through every district in the city, his Lamborghini police car mode screaming down highways while Tachy zipped through alleys too narrow for him to follow. Every time he got close, she'd leave another doodle—on a street sign, a fountain, even the back of a city bus.

"She drew a mustache on the MAYOR'S STATUE!" Blue Cop roared into his communicator. "This is ANARCHY!"

Back at Edo Motors, Jun winced. "Maybe I should go help—"

"Nah," Mega Trucker said, casually munching on what appeared to be a spare tire. "Let Blue Cop handle it. He needs to learn that not every problem is solved by chasing it."

Anna looked at Mega Trucker with surprise. "That's... actually really insightful."

"I have my moments," Mega Trucker grinned. "Also, I'm pretty sure Tachy's running circles around him right now. Literally."

By sunset, Blue Cop returned to Edo Motors, exhausted and humiliated. His sleek police car mode was covered in at least thirty new cheetah doodles—on his doors, his hood, even his roof.

"I couldn't catch her," he admitted, his voice heavy with defeat. "She's faster than anything I've ever encountered. Every time I cornered her, she'd slip away and leave another... another DRAWING on me!"

Mega Trucker took one look at Blue Cop and burst out laughing. His deep, booming laugh shook the tools hanging on Edo's walls.

"It's NOT funny!"

"Brother, it's a LITTLE funny," Mega Trucker wheezed, wiping a lubricant tear from his optic. "You look like a moving art gallery!"

Blue Cop slumped against the garage wall, something he never did. "I don't understand. Why does she do this? Why can't she just follow the rules?"

Mega Trucker stopped laughing. He sat down next to Blue Cop, which was a significant event given that the dump truck bot's sitting down sounded like a small building being demolished.

"You know what I think?" Mega Trucker said. "I think you're asking the wrong question."

"What do you mean?"

"You keep asking WHY she breaks the rules. But have you ever asked her why she DRAWS?"

Blue Cop blinked. "That's... the same question."

"Nah, man. It's totally different." Mega Trucker leaned back. "When I first got to Earth, I was lost. Confused. Scared, even—though don't you DARE tell anyone I said that. Everything was strange. No Machina, no routines, no home. You know what saved me?"

"What?"

"Music. Soul music." Mega Trucker patted his chest. "I heard it playing from a shop window and something just... clicked. It was like the music said, 'Hey big guy, you're gonna be okay.' It gave me something to hold onto."

Blue Cop was quiet for a long moment. "You think the drawing is Tachy's music?"

"I think that girl's been on Earth for two weeks, she's a Wild Cardbot who just got cured of a virus that made her feral, and she doesn't know a single bot here besides us. She's fast—fastest thing alive, probably. But being fast means the world moves slow around you. Everyone else is standing still."

Mega Trucker tapped the side of his head. "That's gotta be lonely."

Blue Cop found Tachy at the city overpass at midnight.

She wasn't running. She wasn't doodling. She was just sitting on the railing, legs dangling, staring out at the city lights. The moonlight caught her cheetah-patterned armor, making it shimmer like scattered stars.

She heard him coming—of course she did—but she didn't run.

"I'm not going to chase you," Blue Cop said.

"Good. Because you can't catch me anyway," Tachy replied, but there was no bite in it this time.

Blue Cop stood next to her, looking out at the same view. Mowtown was beautiful at night, its lights twinkling like a ground-level galaxy.

"Why do you draw, Tachy?" he asked quietly.

She didn't answer right away. When she finally spoke, her voice was smaller than he'd ever heard it.

"Because on Machina, when the Beast Virus took me... I couldn't think. I couldn't feel. I was just... running and destroying and running and destroying. No thoughts. No creativity. Nothing but instinct."

She traced a claw along the railing, leaving a tiny scratch in the shape of a star.

"When Jun freed me—when I could THINK again—everything was so... overwhelming. Earth is so different. So colorful. So ALIVE. And I just... I wanted to leave a mark. Something that said 'Tachy was here, and she was HERSELF, not a virus.'"

Blue Cop felt something shift in his Machinasium core. It was uncomfortable and unfamiliar—but he recognized it from the lessons Jun kept trying to teach him.

Empathy.

"I understand," he said softly. "More than you might think."

Tachy looked at him suspiciously. "You're not going to arrest me?"

"No." Blue Cop paused. "But I AM going to ask you to stop drawing on buildings."

"But—"

"Because," he continued, "I think we can find you something better."

The next morning, Mega Trucker showed up at Edo Motors with a surprise: twenty massive blank canvases, six buckets of paint in every color imaginable, and a portable speaker blasting soul music at full volume.

"WHAT is happening?!" Edo shouted from his garage, nearly dropping his wrench.

"ART HAPPENING!" Mega Trucker announced. "Blue Cop commissioned it!"

Blue Cop stood nearby, looking stiff and slightly embarrassed. "I... spoke with the Mayor's office. Anna helped. The city has agreed to designate the old tunnel near the park as an official public art space. Anyone can paint there freely and legally."

Tachy stared at him. "You did that... for me?"

"For the city," Blue Cop corrected. "Unauthorized graffiti is still a crime. But AUTHORIZED art is a community benefit. It's a compromise."

"Nah, he did it for you," Mega Trucker whispered loudly. "He was up ALL night making calls."

"MEGA TRUCKER!"

Tachy's face broke into the widest grin any of them had ever seen. Before Blue Cop could react, she had zoomed around him at top speed—and this time, instead of doodling on him, she wrapped him in a hug so fast it was over before his threat detection systems even activated.

"Thank you," she said, already bouncing on her Sonic Runner leg armor. "Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!"

"You're... welcome," Blue Cop managed, looking flustered for the first time in his entire existence.

The Mowtown Tunnel Art Project became the talk of the city within a week.

Tachy painted at her natural speed—her cheetah doodles evolved from messy scribbles into stunning murals that captured movement and energy like nothing anyone had ever seen. A mural of all the Cardbots, mid-transformation, stretched across thirty meters of tunnel wall. Another showed the night sky over Machina, a planet none of them would ever see again, rendered in blues and silvers that seemed to glow.

"She's actually really talented," Jun said, amazed. "When she has the space to work, her art is incredible."

Even Shadow X came to admire them—though he insisted it was just "threat assessment of public infrastructure."

Mega Trucker, naturally, appointed himself the official DJ of the art tunnel. He played soul music from speakers he'd convinced Edo to build, and sometimes he'd dance while Tachy painted, the big dump truck bot moving with surprising grace while the fastest Cardbot alive turned blank walls into worlds.

Blue Cop visited every day. He told everyone it was to "ensure compliance with the designated art zone regulations." But Jun noticed that the old cop always lingered in front of the Machina night sky mural, studying it with a softness in his optics that the stoic lawman would never admit to.

One afternoon, Tachy handed Blue Cop a spray can.

"What is this for?" he asked, holding it like it might explode.

"You too, officer. Everyone gets to leave their mark."

"I am not an artist."

"Everyone's an artist. You just haven't tried."

Blue Cop stared at the can, then at the wall. Slowly, carefully, with the precision of a former Star Guardian, he painted a small blue shield with a star in the center—the symbol of the Machina police force.

It was simple. It was perfect.

Tachy grinned and painted a cheetah face right next to it.

"There," she said. "Now we're both here."

## The Lesson

**Creativity is not something to be punished—it's something to be channeled.** When Tachy doodled on buildings, she wasn't trying to cause trouble. She was trying to express herself after a terrible experience, to prove she was more than a virus, more than a machine. And Blue Cop learned that being a good officer doesn't always mean enforcing every rule—sometimes it means listening, understanding, and finding a better path forward.

**Remember:** When someone is acting out, there's almost always a deeper reason behind it. Instead of only focusing on stopping the behavior, try to understand the person. And if you're the one who feels like you don't belong—find YOUR canvas. Your voice matters, and there's always a place where your creativity can shine!
