# Roxanne's Vanity Crisis: A Funny Horror Adventure

**Starring:** Roxanne Wolf, Gregory, and Glamrock Freddy

---

## Episode 1: The Mirror Mayhem

It was a typical Tuesday afternoon at Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex when everything went hilariously wrong. Gregory was helping Glamrock Freddy organize the backstage area when they heard a loud CRASH from Roxanne's room.

"What was that?" Gregory asked, looking up from the box of spare microphones he was sorting.

"I am not sure, superstar," Freddy replied, his mechanical ears twitching with concern. "Perhaps we should check on Roxanne. She has been... particularly focused on her appearance today."

They walked down the colorful hallway to Roxanne's room, where they found her standing in front of what used to be her favorite mirror. Now it was just a pile of sparkling glass shards on the floor.

"NOOOO!" Roxanne wailed dramatically, her silver hair with the green streak falling over her face. "My beautiful mirror! How am I supposed to know if I look absolutely amazing without it?"

"Uh, Roxy?" Gregory said, trying not to laugh. "You could just... ask someone?"

Roxanne spun around, her yellow eyes wide with horror. "Ask someone? ASK SOMEONE?! What if they LIE? What if they don't have the refined taste to appreciate my incredible beauty?"

Freddy gently patted her shoulder with his orange paw. "Roxanne, you are always beautiful. You do not need a mirror to tell you that."

"But Freddy!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms up dramatically. "Without my mirror, how will I practice my 'I'm the best' poses? How will I perfect my keytar stance? How will I make sure my makeup isn't smudged?"

Just then, the lights in the room started flickering ominously. A low, spooky voice echoed through the air: "If you cannot see your reflection... how do you know you even exist?"

All three of them froze. Gregory grabbed Freddy's arm. "Okay, that was definitely creepy and not funny."

"Do not worry, superstar," Freddy said, though his voice sounded a bit shaky. "I am sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation forâ€”"

"AHHHHH!" Roxanne screamed, pointing at the broken mirror. "The mirror is talking! It's haunted! I've been so beautiful that I've attracted a GHOST!"

The voice continued: "Without your reflection, you will fade away... become nothing... unless you find the True Mirror of Self-Worth before midnight!"

"Oh great," Gregory muttered. "A time limit. Because that's not stressful at all."

## Episode 2: The Vain Search Begins

The trio decided to search the entire Pizzaplex for this mysterious "True Mirror of Self-Worth." But first, they had to deal with Roxanne's growing panic attacks.

"I can't go out there!" she cried, hiding behind Freddy. "What if people see me without knowing exactly how fabulous I look? What if my hair is messy? What if my makeup is wrong?"

"Roxy," Gregory said patiently, "you literally look exactly the same as always."

"But I don't FEEL the same!" she wailed. "I need constant validation! I need to know I'm the most beautiful, most talented, most amazing animatronic in the entire Pizzaplex!"

Freddy cleared his throat. "Perhaps we should start our search systematically. Gregory, do you have any ideas about where we might find this mirror?"

Gregory scratched his head. "Well, if it's a 'True Mirror of Self-Worth,' maybe it's somewhere that would teach someone about, you know, actual self-worth?"

"The library!" Roxanne gasped. "No, wait, that's boring. The arcade! No, that's too noisy. Oh! The kitchen where they make the beautiful pizzas that are almost as perfect as me!"

"Let's just start with the arcade," Gregory suggested. "At least if we don't find anything, we can play some games."

As they walked through the Pizzaplex, strange things began happening. Every reflective surface they passed - windows, polished floors, even the glass covering the prize machines - began showing distorted, funhouse-mirror versions of Roxanne.

"Oh no!" she shrieked at a particularly wavy reflection. "I look like a stretched-out noodle! This is worse than I thought!"

"Roxanne," Freddy said gently, "those are just distorted reflections. They are not real."

"But what if they ARE real and my regular mirror was lying to me all this time?" she moaned. "What if I've actually been hideous and nobody told me?"

Gregory rolled his eyes. "Roxy, you're being ridiculous. You're the same robot you were this morning."

Suddenly, all the lights went out. In the darkness, they heard Roxanne's voice, but it sounded different - deeper, more menacing:

"I am the most beautiful... I am the most talented... I am the BEST... and anyone who disagrees will face my wrath!"

"Uh, Roxy?" Gregory called out nervously. "That's... that's you, right?"

When the lights came back on, Roxanne was standing in a dramatic pose with her claws extended, looking quite scary. But then she immediately relaxed and looked confused.

"Was I just doing my villain pose? I don't remember deciding to do that."

"This is getting weirder," Gregory muttered.

## Episode 3: The Confidence Monster

As they continued searching, Roxanne's behavior became increasingly erratic. One moment she'd be sobbing about not being beautiful enough, and the next she'd be striking dramatic poses and declaring herself the ruler of the Pizzaplex.

"I am ROXANNE WOLF!" she announced, jumping onto a table in the food court. "I am the most magnificent creature ever created! Bow before my beauty!"

"Okay, that's definitely not normal," Gregory said. "Freddy, I think the ghost thing is making her act weird."

"I agree, superstar. It seems as though her personality is becoming... amplified."

Suddenly, Roxanne jumped down from the table and started running around in circles, chasing her own tail. "If I can't see my reflection, I'll just have to become my own mirror! I'll spin fast enough to see myself!"

"Roxanne, stop!" Freddy called out. "You are making yourself dizzy!"

But it was too late. Roxanne spun so fast that she crashed into a display of pizza boxes, sending them flying everywhere. When the cardboard settled, she was sitting in the middle of the mess, looking dazed.

"Did... did I just try to chase my own tail?" she asked weakly.

"Yep," Gregory said. "And it was actually pretty funny."

"This is not funny!" she cried. "I'm losing my mind! What if I'm not beautiful? What if I'm not talented? What if I'm just... ordinary?"

For the first time since the mirror broke, Roxanne looked genuinely sad instead of dramatic. She sat quietly among the pizza boxes, her usual confidence completely gone.

"What if everyone has been lying to me?" she whispered. "What if I'm not special at all?"

Freddy sat down beside her. "Roxanne, you are special. But not because of how you look."

"But looking good is all I know how to do," she said quietly. "If I'm not the most beautiful, then what am I?"

Before anyone could answer, a creepy laugh echoed through the food court. "Exactly! What ARE you without your vanity? Let's find out!"

All the lights went out again, and when they came back on, Roxanne was gone.

"Roxy?" Gregory called out. "ROXY!"

From somewhere in the darkness, they heard her voice: "I am nothing... I am nobody... I am not the best at anything..."

## Episode 4: The Real Roxanne

Gregory and Freddy frantically searched the Pizzaplex, following the sound of Roxanne's voice. They found her in the most unexpected place - the maintenance room, sitting quietly by herself, not posing or checking her reflection in anything.

"Roxy?" Gregory said carefully. "Are you okay?"

"I've been thinking," she said without looking up. "Maybe the ghost is right. Maybe I am nothing without my looks."

"That is not true," Freddy said firmly. "You are so much more than your appearance."

"Like what?" she asked sadly. "All I do is look in mirrors and tell everyone how great I am."

Gregory sat down next to her. "Are you kidding? You're an awesome keytar player! You can race go-karts better than anyone. You always stand up for yourself. And..." he paused, "you actually care about people, even if you don't always show it."

"But I'm mean to everyone," Roxanne said. "I'm always bragging and putting others down."

"Yeah, but remember when that little kid was crying because he lost his toy?" Gregory said. "You helped him find it. You thought no one was watching, but I saw you."

Roxanne looked up in surprise. "You saw that?"

"And remember when you stayed late to help reprogram the go-karts so they'd be safer for younger kids?" Freddy added. "You did not want recognition for that either."

"I... I forgot about those things," Roxanne said softly.

Just then, the creepy voice returned: "Touching! But it doesn't matter! You've spent so much time focusing on your appearance that you've forgotten who you really are! Soon, you'll disappear completely!"

"No!" Roxanne stood up suddenly. "I won't disappear! I'm not just a pretty face! I'm Roxanne Wolf, and I'm... I'm..."

"You're what?" the voice taunted.

Roxanne took a deep breath. "I'm a friend. I'm a musician. I'm someone who cares about others, even when I'm too scared to show it. I'm someone who works hard to be good at things. And yes, I like looking good, but that's not ALL I am!"

The voice laughed. "Pretty words, but can you prove it?"

"Watch me!" Roxanne said confidently.

## Episode 5: The Mirror of Truth

The ghost's voice led them to a hidden room behind the stage that none of them had ever seen before. In the center of the room was an ornate mirror that seemed to glow with its own light.

"The True Mirror of Self-Worth," the voice announced. "Look into it, and see yourself as you truly are. But be warned - not everyone likes what they see."

Roxanne approached the mirror nervously. "What if I really am just a vain, shallow robot?"

"Then you'll learn something," Gregory said encouragingly. "And that's better than not knowing."

Roxanne took a deep breath and looked into the mirror. Instead of her usual reflection, she saw herself helping the crying child find his toy. Then she saw herself working late to fix the go-karts. Then she saw herself playing her keytar with genuine joy, not just showing off.

"I... I see myself being kind," she said in wonder. "I see myself actually caring about my music, not just using it to get attention."

"And?" the voice asked.

"And I see someone who's so afraid of not being good enough that she acts like she's better than everyone else," Roxanne continued. "I see someone who's actually pretty insecure but covers it up with bragging."

The mirror began to show her reflection as she really was - not perfect, not the most beautiful animatronic in the world, but someone genuine and real.

"I'm not perfect," she said, looking at her friends. "I'm not the most beautiful or the most talented. But I'm real. I'm me. And that's... that's actually pretty good."

The ghost's voice began to fade: "Congratulations, Roxanne Wolf. You have found your true self-worth. You are worthy not because you are perfect, but because you are authentic."

The mysterious mirror began to dissolve, but as it did, every reflective surface in the room started working normally again. Roxanne looked at her reflection in a regular mirror and smiled - not her usual dramatic, "I'm the best" smile, but a genuine, happy smile.

"You know what?" she said to her reflection. "You're pretty cool, Roxy. Not because you're perfect, but because you're real."

## Episode 6: The New Roxanne

The next day, the Pizzaplex was buzzing with activity as usual. But something was different about Roxanne Wolf.

"Good morning, everyone!" she said cheerfully to Gregory and Freddy. "How are you doing today?"

Gregory nearly dropped his Fizzy-Faz. "Uh, good morning, Roxy. Are you... feeling okay?"

"I'm feeling great!" she said. "I realized I don't need to spend two hours every morning telling myself I'm the best. I already know I'm pretty cool."

"That is wonderful to hear," Freddy said, beaming. "How did you sleep?"

"Really well, actually. I didn't have any nightmares about my makeup running or my hair getting messy." She paused and grinned. "Though I did have a dream about playing keytar in front of a huge crowd, and they were cheering because the music was awesome, not because I looked good."

As they walked through the Pizzaplex, Gregory noticed that Roxanne was acting completely different. When a little girl complimented her hair, instead of launching into a speech about how she was the most beautiful animatronic ever, Roxanne simply said, "Thank you! I like your hair too!"

When they passed a mirror, instead of stopping to pose and admire herself for ten minutes, she just glanced at it, fixed a small smudge on her cheek, and kept walking.

"Roxy," Gregory said, "you're being almost... normal."

"Is that bad?" she asked, looking worried.

"No!" Gregory said quickly. "It's great! It's just... different."

"Well, I figured out that I was spending so much time trying to convince everyone I was amazing that I forgot to actually BE amazing," she said thoughtfully. "So now I'm going to focus on being good at things instead of just saying I'm good at things."

"That's very wise," Freddy said approvingly.

Just then, Montgomery Gator walked by and grumbled, "Great, now Roxy's going to be all humble and stuff. How am I supposed to compete with that?"

"You don't have to compete with anyone, Monty," Roxanne said kindly. "You're awesome at being you."

Monty looked so shocked that he walked into a wall.

"Okay, that was pretty funny," Gregory laughed.

## Epilogue: The Lesson Learned

That evening, as the Pizzaplex was closing down, Gregory found Roxanne in her room, practicing her keytar. She was concentrating intently on the music, not checking her reflection every few seconds.

"Hey Roxy," he said. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure!" she said, setting down her keytar.

"Do you miss it? Being super vain and always talking about how great you looked?"

Roxanne thought for a moment. "You know, I thought I would. But I don't. I mean, I still like looking good - there's nothing wrong with caring about your appearance. But I don't need to be the most beautiful animatronic in the world to feel good about myself."

"So what makes you feel good about yourself now?"

"When I play a song really well, or when I help someone, or when I make a friend laugh," she said. "Those feelings last longer than just looking in a mirror and saying 'I'm the best.'"

Freddy appeared in the doorway. "That sounds like true self-worth to me."

"Exactly," Roxanne said. "I learned that real confidence comes from knowing who you are and being proud of your actions, not just your appearance. And you know what? I'm still pretty awesome - just for different reasons now."

"And you're definitely more fun to hang out with," Gregory added with a grin.

"Thanks, kid," Roxanne said, ruffling his hair. "Want to hear the new song I've been working on? I wrote it about friendship."

As Roxanne began to play, the music filled the room with a warm, happy feeling. It wasn't perfect, but it was real, and it came from the heart.

And in the corner of the room, her repaired mirror reflected not just her image, but the joy on her face as she played music for her friends - and that was the most beautiful thing of all.

## **The Lesson Learned**

Roxanne Wolf learned that **true self-worth comes from within, not from external validation or appearance.** While there's nothing wrong with caring about how you look or wanting to be good at things, your real value comes from:

- **Being kind to others**
- **Working hard to improve your skills**
- **Being authentic and genuine**
- **Helping people when they need it**
- **Having good friendships**

The story teaches us that:

1. **Confidence built only on appearance is fragile** - it can be shattered easily
2. **Real confidence comes from knowing your worth as a person**
3. **It's okay to like looking good, but it shouldn't be your only source of self-esteem**
4. **Being humble and kind makes you more likeable than being boastful**
5. **True friends value you for who you are, not just how you look**

Most importantly, Roxanne discovered that when you stop spending all your time trying to convince others you're amazing, you have more time to actually BE amazing through your actions, kindness, and genuine connections with others.

**The End**
