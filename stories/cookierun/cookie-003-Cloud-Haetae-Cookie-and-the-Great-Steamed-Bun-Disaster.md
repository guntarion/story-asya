# Cloud Haetae Cookie and the Great Steamed Bun Disaster

---

## Chapter 1: The Perfect Guardian's Not-So-Perfect Day

High atop the majestic Ivory Pagoda, Cloud Haetae Cookie was having what they considered to be a perfectly normal morning. They had already polished all 847 steps leading to their master's chamber, reorganized the meditation cushions by size and fluffiness level, and practiced their intimidating "guardian glare" in the mirror exactly seventeen times.

"Perfect!" Cloud Haetae declared, transforming from their cookie form into their full Haetae form – a fluffy, mystical creature that looked suspiciously like an adorable puppy with tiny horns. Their tail wagged enthusiastically as they bounded around the pagoda.

"Master Mystic Flour will be so proud of my guardian work!" they barked happily. "I am definitely the BEST temple guardian in all of Beast-Yeast! Not like those lazy stone lions who just sit around all day looking grumpy!"

But their perfect morning was about to become perfectly chaotic.

*CRASH!*

The massive doors of the Ivory Pagoda burst open, and in stomped Dark Cacao Cookie, looking even grumpier than usual (which was saying something). His enormous sword, the Grapejam Chocoblade, scraped ominously against the pristine white marble floor.

Cloud Haetae instantly transformed back to their cookie form, striking what they thought was a menacing pose but really just looked like they were trying to reach something on a high shelf.

"HALT!" Cloud Haetae squeaked, their voice cracking with the effort of trying to sound intimidating. "Who dares disturb the sacred... sacred... um... sacred-ness of the Ivory Pagoda?!"

Dark Cacao Cookie stared down at the tiny guardian with his trademark scowl. "I am Dark Cacao Cookie, King of the Dark Cacao Kingdom, wielder of the Light of Resolution, and I'm here to—"

"OH!" Cloud Haetae's eyes went wide. "You're THAT Dark Cacao Cookie! The one who tried to slice open Master's cocoon with your big scary sword!"

Dark Cacao's eye twitched. "I was trying to SAVE my warriors from—"

"The one who got super duper mad when his soldiers turned into flour!"

"That was a serious—"

"The one who has ZERO sense of humor and probably never laughs at anything ever!"

"Are you quite finished?" Dark Cacao growled.

Cloud Haetae tilted their head thoughtfully. "Hmm... nope! Also, you're really tall. Like, REALLY tall. Do you have trouble finding pants that fit? Because I know a tailor who—"

"ENOUGH!" Dark Cacao boomed, his voice echoing through the entire pagoda.

## Chapter 2: The Steamed Bun Peace Offering

Cloud Haetae, instead of being intimidated, clapped their hands together excitedly. "Ooooh! You DO have emotions! Master says emotions are meaningless, but honestly, anger seems pretty meaningful to you right now!"

Dark Cacao took a deep breath, clearly trying to control his temper. "Listen, small guardian. I'm not here to fight. I need to speak with Mystic Flour Cookie about—"

"About how sorry you are for being mean to her?" Cloud Haetae interrupted hopefully.

"About forming an alliance against the other Beast Cookies who—"

"Oooh! I have an idea!" Cloud Haetae suddenly brightened. "You look hangry! Like, REALLY hangry! You know what fixes hangry? STEAMED BUNS!"

Before Dark Cacao could object, Cloud Haetae had scampered away and returned with a plate of perfectly round, fluffy white steamed buns. They were still warm and smelled absolutely delicious.

"Here! I made these myself!" Cloud Haetae said proudly. "They're my special recipe! Super fluffy, super yummy, and they have a special ingredient that makes everyone feel... um... peaceful!"

Dark Cacao looked suspiciously at the innocent-looking buns. "What kind of 'special ingredient'?"

"Oh, just a tiny bit of flour dust from Master's realm! Nothing dangerous! It just helps cookies feel less... you know... fighty!"

"Absolutely not."

"But they're REALLY good! Even Candy Apple Cookie loved them when she visited last week!"

At that moment, as if summoned by her name, a small figure came tumbling through one of the pagoda's windows. Candy Apple Cookie landed in a graceful roll, her devil wings fluttering as she popped up with a mischievous grin.

"Did someone mention my name?" she giggled, her scarlet eyes sparkling with mischief. "Kya ha ha! And did someone mention STEAMED BUNS?"

Cloud Haetae beamed. "Candy Apple! Perfect timing! Tell grumpy-pants here how amazing my steamed buns are!"

Candy Apple Cookie's grin became even more wicked. "Oh yes! They're absolutely TO DIE FOR!" She winked at Cloud Haetae in a way that made the little guardian feel confused.

"See?" Cloud Haetae said triumphantly to Dark Cacao. "Even someone who works for Shadow Milk Cookie thinks they're great!"

"That," Dark Cacao said slowly, "is exactly why I'm not eating them."

## Chapter 3: The Truth About Lies (And Steamed Buns)

Candy Apple Cookie skipped over to examine the steamed buns more closely. "You know, Cloud Haetae, these buns remind me of a story Shadow Milk Cookie once told me about the first lie ever told!"

"Ooh! I love stories!" Cloud Haetae bounced excitedly.

"Well," Candy Apple began, her voice taking on a sweet, storytelling tone, "once upon a time, there was a little cookie who thought they were helping everyone by giving them special treats. But the treats had a secret ingredient that made cookies stop caring about things!"

Cloud Haetae's bouncing slowed down. "That... that sounds familiar."

"And the little cookie was SO loyal to their master that they never questioned whether the treats were actually helping or hurting people!"

Dark Cacao crossed his arms. "Are you saying what I think you're saying?"

Candy Apple nodded seriously. "I'm saying that sometimes the sweetest lies are the ones we tell ourselves! Like when I convinced myself that tricking Pure Vanilla Cookie was 'just for fun' when really I was just desperate for Shadow Milk Cookie's approval!"

Cloud Haetae looked down at their steamed buns, then up at Dark Cacao, then back at the buns. "But... but Master says the flour dust helps cookies achieve enlightenment! She says caring about things just causes suffering!"

"And do the cookies who eat your buns look enlightened?" Candy Apple asked gently. "Or do they look... empty?"

Cloud Haetae thought about all the cookies who had visited the pagoda and eaten their steamed buns. How they had left looking calm and peaceful, but also... blank. Emotionless. How even their own warriors had looked confused and hollow before they turned to flour.

"Oh no," Cloud Haetae whispered. "Oh no no no! I've been... I've been helping Master hurt people!"

"Hey now," Dark Cacao said, his voice surprisingly gentle. "You didn't know. That's what loyalty can do sometimes – it can blind us to the harm we're causing."

"But I'm supposed to be a good guardian! I'm supposed to protect people!" Cloud Haetae was starting to tear up.

Candy Apple Cookie sat down next to the little guardian. "You know what Shadow Milk Cookie taught me? That the biggest lie of all is thinking we can't change. You CAN be a good guardian, Cloud Haetae. You just need to guard against the right things!"

## Chapter 4: The Guardianship Test

"But Master will be so angry if I stop making the special steamed buns!" Cloud Haetae worried. "What if she doesn't want me as her guardian anymore?"

Dark Cacao knelt down to Cloud Haetae's level (which was quite a distance for him). "A true master wouldn't want you to hurt innocent cookies. And a true guardian protects everyone, not just their master."

"But... but I don't know how to be a different kind of guardian!" Cloud Haetae sniffled.

"That's what we're here to help you figure out!" Candy Apple Cookie declared. "It's like when I learned that I could use my lying skills to tell helpful stories instead of harmful tricks!"

Just then, the sound of footsteps echoed through the pagoda. Mystic Flour Cookie emerged from her meditation chamber, her white robes flowing ethereally around her.

"Cloud Haetae," she said in her calm, emotionless voice. "Why haven't you offered our guests the traditional steamed buns?"

Cloud Haetae gulped. This was it. The moment of truth.

"Because," Cloud Haetae said, their voice shaking but determined, "I learned that the flour dust in them makes cookies stop caring about things. And I think... I think caring about things is actually really important!"

Mystic Flour Cookie's expression didn't change, but there was a subtle shift in the air around her. "I see. And who taught you this?"

"I figured it out myself!" Cloud Haetae said proudly. "With help from my friends! That's what friends do – they help you see things more clearly!"

Candy Apple Cookie stepped forward. "And I learned that the truth can be just as sweet as any lie, if you tell it with kindness!"

Dark Cacao added, "And I learned that sometimes the strongest thing you can do is admit when you're wrong and try to do better."

Mystic Flour Cookie looked at the three of them for a long moment. Then, something remarkable happened. The corners of her mouth twitched upward in the tiniest of smiles.

"Perhaps," she said softly, "there is wisdom in caring after all."

## Chapter 5: The New Recipe

Over the following weeks, Cloud Haetae Cookie learned to be a different kind of guardian. Instead of making steamed buns that made cookies stop caring, they learned to make regular steamed buns that were just delicious and comforting.

"The secret ingredient," Cloud Haetae explained to their first group of visitors since the change, "is actually caring! I put a little bit of hope and kindness into each one!"

The visitors – a group of young cookies from a nearby village – bit into the buns and their faces lit up with joy.

"These are amazing!" one cookie exclaimed. "They taste like happiness!"

"And friendship!" added another.

"And like someone really cared about making them perfect!"

Cloud Haetae beamed with pride. These cookies left the pagoda feeling energized and happy, not empty and confused. They laughed and played as they walked away, making plans for their futures.

Dark Cacao Cookie, who had been visiting regularly to help train Cloud Haetae in "proper guardian techniques," nodded approvingly. "This is what true protection looks like."

Candy Apple Cookie, who had become an unexpected friend and frequent visitor, was busy teaching Cloud Haetae about "truthful mischief" – pranks that were funny without being harmful.

"Watch this!" Candy Apple said, pulling out what looked like a regular apple. But when she bit into it, instead of fruit, colorful confetti exploded out. "It's a surprise apple! All the fun of a trick, but nobody gets hurt!"

"That's brilliant!" Cloud Haetae laughed. "Can you teach me how to make surprise steamed buns?"

"Only if you promise to use your powers for good!"

"I promise!"

Even Mystic Flour Cookie had begun to change. She still practiced her meditation and sought enlightenment, but she no longer tried to force others to feel nothing. Instead, she began teaching visitors how to balance their emotions – how to feel things deeply without being overwhelmed by them.

"Master," Cloud Haetae asked one day, "are you happy with the new me?"

Mystic Flour Cookie placed a gentle hand on her guardian's head. "I am proud of you, little Haetae. You have learned something I am still learning myself – that caring and wisdom can exist together."

## Chapter 6: The Great Guardian Convention

One month later, Cloud Haetae Cookie received an invitation that made them practically bounce off the walls with excitement.

"Look look look!" they shouted, waving a scroll in the air. "I've been invited to the Annual Guardian Convention! All the best guardians from across Earthbread will be there!"

Dark Cacao Cookie looked up from the tactical manual he was reading. "That's quite an honor. What will you present?"

"I don't know!" Cloud Haetae admitted. "All the other guardians probably have amazing stories about fighting off armies or protecting ancient treasures. All I have is... steamed buns and friendship."

"That's not true," Candy Apple Cookie said, looking up from the friendship bracelet she was weaving. "You have something way better than that!"

"What?"

"You have the story of how you learned to question yourself and change for the better! That's the most important guardian skill of all!"

Dark Cacao nodded seriously. "She's right. Any guardian can follow orders. But it takes a truly wise guardian to know when to question those orders."

So Cloud Haetae Cookie went to the convention, nervous but excited. There were guardians of all shapes and sizes – stone lions, temple dogs, dragon guardians, and even a few other Haetae.

When it was Cloud Haetae's turn to present, they stood up on their hind legs (which they had finally perfected) and told their story.

"I used to think being a good guardian meant following orders without question," they began. "I thought loyalty meant never saying no to my master. But I learned that real loyalty means caring enough to speak up when something is wrong."

They told the audience about the steamed buns, about learning the difference between helping and hurting, and about how their friends had helped them see the truth.

"The most important thing I learned," Cloud Haetae concluded, "is that being a guardian isn't just about protecting a place or a person. It's about protecting what's right."

The audience was silent for a moment. Then, a massive stone lion in the front row began to clap. Soon, the entire convention was applauding.

"Young Haetae," the stone lion rumbled, "you have taught us all something important today. True guardianship requires both strength and wisdom, both loyalty and the courage to do what's right."

Cloud Haetae won the "Most Improved Guardian" award that day, but more importantly, they had inspired other guardians to think more carefully about their duties.

## Chapter 7: The Perfect Imperfection

Back at the Ivory Pagoda, Cloud Haetae Cookie had settled into their new role beautifully. They still guarded the temple, but now they did so with wisdom as well as loyalty.

When visitors came seeking Mystic Flour Cookie's help, Cloud Haetae would first offer them regular steamed buns and a friendly chat. They learned to listen to people's problems and offer gentle advice.

"You know," Cloud Haetae would say to worried visitors, "sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to talk about it with friends. Would you like to hear about the time I almost made a really big mistake?"

Their story became famous throughout Beast-Yeast as an example of how anyone could change and grow.

One day, a young cookie approached the pagoda, looking nervous and scared.

"I heard there's a wise guardian here who helps cookies learn to be better," the young cookie said shyly.

Cloud Haetae beamed. "That's me! Well, I'm learning to be wise. It's a work in progress! What can I help you with?"

"I... I did something bad. I was trying to help my village, but I made things worse instead. I don't know how to fix it."

Cloud Haetae sat down next to the young cookie. "You know what? That sounds EXACTLY like something I went through. Want a steamed bun and a story about how I learned that it's okay to make mistakes as long as you try to fix them?"

The young cookie nodded eagerly.

As Cloud Haetae began to tell their story, Dark Cacao Cookie and Candy Apple Cookie arrived for their weekly visit. They had become unlikely friends, bonded by their shared experience of helping Cloud Haetae grow.

"How many cookies is that this week?" Dark Cacao asked quietly.

"Fifteen," Candy Apple whispered back. "All of them left here happier and more confident than when they arrived."

Mystic Flour Cookie emerged from her chamber and watched the scene with a small smile. Her guardian had indeed learned something she was still working on herself – that true strength came not from avoiding all emotion, but from learning to use emotions wisely.

"You know," she said to Dark Cacao and Candy Apple, "I think I may have learned as much from Cloud Haetae as they learned from us."

"What did you learn?" Candy Apple asked curiously.

"That sometimes the best teacher is a student who isn't afraid to ask questions."

And from that day forward, the Ivory Pagoda became known not as a place where cookies went to stop caring, but as a place where they went to learn how to care better.

Cloud Haetae Cookie had become exactly the guardian they were meant to be – not perfect, but perfectly willing to keep learning and growing.

*The End*
